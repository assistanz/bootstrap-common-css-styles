# bootstrap-common-css-styles

We provide customized classes to use bootstrap easily.

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

Bootstrap has provided many classes to design our web pages. They didn't provide classes for adjusting top, bottom and font sizes. In this repository we will provide some classes to easily align the elements with top, bottom and font sizes.

We provide BOWER and SASS support.

## Examples

`` <div class="mgn-top1"> ... </div> ``

`` <div class="png-top10"> ... </div> ``

`` <div class="mgn-top1 png-top10"> ... </div> ``

`` <span class="top1">...</span> ``

`` <span class="btm5 fnt-12">...</span> ``

`` <h1 class="fnt-13">...</h1> ``

`` <p class="fnt-15">...</p> ``
